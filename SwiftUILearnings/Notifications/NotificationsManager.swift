/**
 User facing notifications play an important role in communicating users of apps important information about
 some events they might be interested in or about some event in the app they might need to know about.
 
 User notifications can be
 - Local Notifications
 - Remote Notifications
 
 `Local Notifications`
 App can generate notifications locally by specifying the content and condition for delivery like time or location which
 will trigger the application.
 User can change authorization status anytime so before scheduling a local notification one should always check
 the status.
 
 `Remote Notifications`
 Remote notifications are

    /// the actual notification, so user may not have complete context how a notification looks for the app and if
