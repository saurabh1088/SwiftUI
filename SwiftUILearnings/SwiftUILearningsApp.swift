import SwiftUI

/// @main here is an attribute. Source : https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/attributes
/// Attributes gives us some additional information for the type or declarations on which those are applied.
/// Some declaration attributes can also accespt arguments.
///
/// For e.g. @available attribute
/// ```
/// @available(iOS 14, *)
/// ```
///
/// @main here indicates that `SwiftUILearningsApp` is the entry point of the application. When @main
/// attribute is used on a struct, class or enum then that struct, class or enum is expected to provide a main
/// type function having no arguments and returning void
/// ```
/// static func main() { }
/// ```
/// Now but there isn't any main function defined anywhere in `SwiftUILearningsApp` at all so how does
/// it works. Well this works because of conformance to protocol `App`. A default implementation has been added
/// via a protocol extension to protocol `App`, hence to declare main function is no longer required.
/// The default implementation as per protocol extension implementation will take care of launching app in platform
/// appropriate way.
/// If however a main method is implemented in `SwiftUILearningsApp` then that method gets called and
/// app will fail to launch as there is no way to call default implementation from within custom implementation.
/// (NOTE : Explore this point of overriding main method implementation)
